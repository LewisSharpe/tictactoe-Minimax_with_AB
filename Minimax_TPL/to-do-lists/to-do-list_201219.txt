to do from meeting on 20/12/19

TO DO FOR PARALLEL VERSION
1. valid result - check that parallel result is the same as sequential, hit all paths in tree 
2. # mono FLAG for no of cores/threads used --> 
- see: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-runsafe?man=mono , https://www.mono-project.com/docs/debug+profile/profile/profiler/ 
- Like others have already said, you can run .NET applications on Mono. If your applications use Platform Invocation (P/Invoke) 
to call native code, you may run into some trouble if there is no Mono implementation of the native library. To check whether 
your application does that (or uses APIs that haven't been implemented in Mono yet),you can use the Mono Migration Analyzer (MoMA).
