to do
lock board (release when printing)
valid result - check that parallel result is the same as sequential, hit all paths in tree
lower score for no build
check strided iteration is as expected (no duplicated move - correctness)
noMoveHasBeenCheckedTwice() function (check 4 lists)
check performance --> in directory with source code --> xbuild --> mono bin/Debug/Minimax_TPL.exe
which mcs /opt/mono/bin/mcs
# mono FLAG for no of cores/threads used
status of cores --> top, htop
revised timeplan
timestamp elapsed time, timestamp for threads and work done
Enterprise version --> look at parallel tools
performance measuring
performance tuning

in progress
